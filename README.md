# Sherwin's Adventure
This is my complete redo of Sherwin's Adventure, this time not for the GBA.
At first, it's going to use SFML for the main graphics, audio, and input
facilities, but there are plans to, if I get far enough in the project, to
support 3D graphics as well.


## Reasoning for No More GBA Version
Sherwin's Adventure for the GBA never made it very far, and I'd really like
to actually *complete* the game.  The original code base was not very well
written, and I was originally just going to rewrite the GBA code.  I
changed my mind, however, because I realized I can implement more of my
ideas by making a game for modern systems.
