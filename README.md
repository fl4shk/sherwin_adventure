# Sherwin's Adventure
This is my complete redo of Sherwin's Adventure, this time not for the GBA.
At first, it's going to use SFML for the main graphics, audio, and input
facilities, but there are plans to, if I get far enough in the project, to
support 3D graphics as well.


## Reasoning for No More GBA Version
I decided to make a small game with about 10 levels for the GBA instead.
